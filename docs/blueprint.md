# **App Name**: CertiFolio

## Core Features:

- Certification Grid: Display certifications in a responsive grid layout that adjusts from 3 columns on desktop to 1 column on mobile.
- Certification Card: A reusable card widget that displays certification title, institution, date, and a 'View Credential' button.
- Glassmorphism Effect: Apply a frosted glass effect to the AppBar (header) and buttons, mimicking iOS 26 design using BackdropFilter.
- Data Mock: Utilize a List<Map<String, dynamic>> structure to populate the certification grid, allowing for easy updates.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the design is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#301934), reminiscent of high-end design.
- Background color: Near-black (#121212), to provide strong contrast.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF) to guide attention to UI controls and details, and highlight glass morphism.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, outlined icons to complement the Glassmorphism effect and maintain a clean aesthetic.
- Maintain generous spacing and padding, in keeping with the example. The grid should automatically adjust from 3 columns (desktop) to 1 column (mobile).
- Subtle, smooth transitions and animations when certifications are loaded or when the user interacts with the 'View Credential' buttons.
